UR-BOARD-VER. 1.0
INTRODUCTION

This project is aimed at creating a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards.
In one glance, it will tell you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and
where something is in a process. Imagine a whiteboard, filled with lists of sticky
notes, with each note as a task for you and your team. Now imagine that each of
those sticky notes has photos, attachments, comments and collaborate with your
teammates. Now imagine that you can take that whiteboard anywhere you go
and can access it from any computer through the web.That's the web application
you have to develop.
